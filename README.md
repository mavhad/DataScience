# Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM


Here,I have used the datset provided by Lets grow more which was of TATAGLOBAL.

Long Short Term Memory

Long Short-Term Memory models are extremely powerful time-series models. They can predict an arbitrary number of steps into the future.

Steps used in prediction and forecasting stocks

1.Importing the Libraries

2.Getting Visualising the Data

3.Print the DataFrame Shape and Check for Null Values.

4.Plotting the True Adjusted Close Value.

5.Setting the Target Variable and Selecting the Features.

6.Scaling.

7.Splitting to a Training Set and Test Set.

8.Processing the Data For LSTM.

9.Building the Stacked LSTM Model.

10.Training the Model.

11.LSTM Prediction.

12.True vs Predicted Adj Close Value â€“ LSTM
