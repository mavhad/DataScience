Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

Here,I have used the datset provided by Lets grow more which was of TATAGLOBAL.

Long Short Term Memory

Long Short-Term Memory models are extremely powerful time-series models. They can predict an arbitrary number of steps into the future.

Steps used in prediction and forecasting stocks

Importing the Libraries
Getting Visualising the Data
Print the DataFrame Shape and Check for Null Values.
Plotting the True Adjusted Close Value
Setting the Target Variable and Selecting the Features
Scaling
Splitting to a Training Set and Test Set.
Processing the Data For LSTM
Building the Stacked LSTM Model
Training the Model
LSTM Prediction
True vs Predicted Adj Close Value â€“ LSTM
